AWS Glue → A serverless data catalog + ETL service. It helps you discover, catalog, and prepare data.

Amazon EMR (Elastic MapReduce) → A managed big data platform that can run Apache Spark, Hadoop, Presto, etc. Spark is great for large-scale distributed data processing.

Together:

Glue catalogs the JSON logs in S3 (so they’re queryable).

EMR (with Spark) spins up a cluster to run SQL queries or transformations.



When You’d Actually Use Glue + EMR
If logs were huge and complex (multi-terabyte daily, requiring heavy transformations).

If you needed machine learning preprocessing or complex joins across massive datasets.

If you wanted persistent big data pipelines instead of ad-hoc queries.

👉 So think of it like this:

Athena = quick, lightweight, serverless queries.

Glue + EMR (Spark) = heavy-duty data engineering pipelines.
