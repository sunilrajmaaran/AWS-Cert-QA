This customization will be captured in our AMI.

ser vice.
2. Launch Instance: Click on "Launch instances."

3. Choose an AMI: Under "Amazon Machine Image (AMI)," select a Free Tier eligible Amazon Linux 2 AMI (or any other Free Tier Linux AMI).

4. Choose Instance Type: Select the "t2.micro" instance type (Free Tier eligible).

5. Configure Instance Details: Keep the default settings, ensuring it's in your default VPC and a public subnet with "Auto-assign Public IP" enabled.

6. Add Storage: Accept the default 8 GiB root volume.
