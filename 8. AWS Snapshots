8. AWS: Snapshots
Think of snapshots as point-in-time backups foryour EBS volumes.
They are like digital photographs of your data, allowing you to restore it if
something goes wrong.
This is a lifesaver in many scenarios!
AWS: Snapshots - Real time use case - Practical hands-on
Phase 1: Launching a Free Tier EC2 Instance and Creating an EBS Volume with
Data
We'll start by launching an instance and creating an EBS volume, just like in the
previous exercise,
but this time we'll put some important data on it that we'll want to back up with a
snapshot.
1. Navigate to EC2: Open the AWS Management Console and go to the EC2
ser vice.
2. Launch Instance: Click on "Launch instances."
3. Choose an AMI: Under "Amazon Machine Image (AMI)," select a Free Tier
eligible Amazon Linux 2 AMI (or any other Free Tier Linux AMI).
4. Choose Instance Type: Select the "t2.micro" instance type (Free Tier eligible).
5. Configure Instance Details: Keep the default settings, ensuring it's in your
default VPC and a public subnet with "Auto-assign Public IP" enabled.
6. Add Storage: Accept the default 8 GiB root volume.
7. Add Tags (Red9SysTech Logging): Click "Add Tag."
• Key: Name
• Value: cst-R9ST-Snapshot-Source-Instance
• Click "Add Tag" again.
*   Key: Environment

*   Value: Red9SysTech-Demo
